== Description ==
This plugin enhances the accessibility of your website for keyboard and screen reader users by providing a dynamically-generated and highly-configurable menu of the most important places on the page.

# [SkipTo](http://paypal.github.io/skipto/)
SkipTo is a replacement for your old classic "Skipnav" link, (so please use it as such)!
The SkipTo script creates a drop-down menu consisting of the most important places on a given web page. The menu will make it easier for keyboard and screen reader users to quickly jump to the desired location by simply choosing it from the list of options.

# How it works
1.  The SkipTo menu becomes visible the first time the user tabs into the page.
2.  Once the keyboard focus is on the menu, pressing the ENTER key will pull down the list of high-level headings and landmarks on the current page.
3.  Use arrow keys to select your choice and press ENTER to skip to it.
4.  If you decide to reach the menu again, simply press the built-in access key (0 by default).

== Installation ==

The quickest method for installing the importer is to install the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory.

If you would prefer to do things manually then follow these instructions:

1. Unzip `skipTo.zip` in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Edit settings

== Screenshots ==
1. SkipTo expanded on sample site.
2. Settings page in wp-admin to customize SkipTo.
